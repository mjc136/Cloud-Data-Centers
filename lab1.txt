2. Cloud Computing

Why is the Cloud Important?

The cloud is popular because it helps people and businesses store and access data easily, saves money, and can be used from anywhere with the internet.

Good Things About the Cloud

Grows with Needs – It can increase or decrease storage and power when needed.

Saves Money – No need to buy expensive hardware.

Easy to Access – Can be used from any device with internet access.

Problems with the Cloud

Security Issues – Data is stored on someone else’s servers, which could be hacked.

Internet Dependent – If the internet goes down, cloud services can’t be used.

Less Control – Users rely on companies to manage and update cloud services.

3. Virtualization and Virtual Machines

What is a Hypervisor?

A hypervisor is a program that lets one computer run multiple virtual computers by sharing its power and memory.

4. What is a Virtual Machine?

A virtual machine (VM) is like a computer inside a computer. It runs its own system and programs separately, even though it shares the same hardware.

5. Why Use Virtual Machines?

Keeps Things Separate – VMs don’t interfere with each other.

Can Move Easily – VMs can be moved to different computers.

Safer from Viruses – A virus in one VM won’t affect others.

Saves Resources – Runs many VMs on one physical computer.

Great for Testing – Developers can safely test programs without risk.

6. How Are Virtual Machines Used?

Building and Testing Software – Developers can test apps on different systems.

Running Multiple Servers – A single computer can act like many servers.

Using Old Software – Older programs can run on new computers.

Cloud Services – Many cloud providers use VMs to host apps.

Cybersecurity – VMs allow experts to test for security threats safely.

10. Copying Virtual Machines

Copying a VM makes an exact duplicate, which is helpful for:

Backup and Safety – If something goes wrong, a copy is ready.

Fast Setup – New VMs can be made quickly.

Testing – Trying things out without damaging the original VM.
